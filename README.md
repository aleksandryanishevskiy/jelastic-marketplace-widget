The Jelastic Marketplace widget does not depend on any external software, and all the required configs are provided within the current repository. As a result, the integration to any website can be done in a few simple steps:

1. Download the **mp-widget** directory with the required files. For instance, with the following command:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/jelastic/jelastic-marketplace-widget.git`
    > **Note:** The **mp-widget** folder should be located at the root folder of your site.
1. Enable scripts on your server by adding the following lines between the `<head>` and `</body>` tags:
    
    `<script async src="{siteUrl}/mp-widget/js/j-marketplace.js"></script>`
    
    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{siteUrl}/mp-widget/css/j-marketplace.min.css">`

    Ensure that provided **{siteUrl}** is specified correctly.

1. Add the following block to your page code at the position youâ€™d like the widget to be placed at:

    `<div class="j-app-mp"></div>`

1. The repository provides complete source code of the Jelastic Marketplace widget, which is built with the help of the [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) project builder to compile and minimize .js scripts and .less files. If needed, you can utilize Grunt to redefine default styles and change the widget up to your needs.

    More details about the installation and customization of the marketplace are [described in the documentation](https://ops-docs.jelastic.com/custom-marketplace-widget).
